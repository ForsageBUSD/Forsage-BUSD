            Forsage.io is one of the largest smart contract at the moment.... <br>
            <p id="mid">WHY??? </p>
            Reason being that they launched on Tron, Ethereum then BUSD networks respectively.
            <hr>
            In my own terms, I can even define it as <span class="info">King of all smart contracts</span> 😅💡.
            <p id="mid">WHY??? </p>
            Reason being that all their contracts has created new millionaires and billionaires
            in crypto space all in a rapid space of time. CHOKEn't IT?😉🤩

            In order for humans to stand we need two major legs. Forsage BUSD also operates that way too with the aid of
            <span class="info">x3 and x4 slots</span>
            <img src="images/Forsage-x3.4.jpg" alt="Forsage-Slots">
            <br>
            In the diagram ABOVE, You will need⏬ <br>a total sum of $🔟BUSD <br> $2️⃣BSC <br> and a Defi APP.
            <br>
            Note: Still confusing?? Tap here and get them all for <span class="info">#6500</span>
            <hr>
            Furthermore, To explain the confusing part of diagram above.
            Can you spare just <em><b>8minutes 14seconds</b></em>???<br>
            You will need that to watch an EXPLANATORY video clip . <br>
            Here is a layout of what the video entails

            Finally, Do remember that we keep emphasizing on Forsage to be a chained linked forum. <br>
            The <span class="info">x3 slot</span> has 3️⃣ branches EACH. <br>
            The 1st branch 💼 is where your 1st referral earnings($10 BUSD ) goes into <br>
            Same thing goes for the 2nd branch too <br>
            The 3rd branch 🔄 is used for Recycling i.e earnings goes to your Upline.(WHY???😮)
            <hr>
            The <span class="info">x4 slot</span> however has 6️⃣ branches EACH. <br>
            Two direct branches ⬆ & ⬆ whose earnings goes to your upline<br> (WHY???😮) <br>
            Four indirect branches which has 3 branches of 💼 whose earnings goes to your YOU <br>
            and as usual the last one 🔄 is meant for Recycling.
